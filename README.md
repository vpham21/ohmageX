# ohmageX v3.0.3

[ohmage](http://ohmage.org/) is an open-source, mobile to web platform that records, analyzes, and visualizes data from both prompted experience samples entered by the user, as well as continuous streams of data passively collected from sensors or applications onboard the mobile device. 

**ohmageX** is a revamped version of ohmage MWF, which aims to deliver a single-source and platform-independent mobile application integrated with the Ohmage API. It includes enhancements such as a modular event-driven architecture with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) + [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/), automated development workflow enhancements, and extensive use of preprocessors (e.g. [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)).

## Installation and Setup

#### Prerequisites

* Ruby 2.1+
* Node.js 0.10+
* Java JDK 1.6+


#### Build Web Assets

Install dependencies for local build:

```
bundle
npm install
```

WebBlocks requires Bower, ensure it can see it with an export for the `$PATH` that includes the node bin.


```
export NODE_PATH=$(npm config get prefix)/lib/node_modules
```

Compile assets with WebBlocks:

```
node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt exec:blocks_build
```



Compile assets with Grunt:

```
node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt dev
```

If files in `/blocks` weren't updated, you may skip the WebBlocks build.


#### Build Cordova for mobile

The following task prepares the app for iOS builds only, and is required before the first iOS build:

```
grunt ios_firstrun
```

To build for both iOS and Android, execute the following command instead:

```
grunt mobile_firstrun
```


After this, the mobile app can be built at any time with the following:

```
grunt mobile_www_build
```

Note that `mobile_www_build` creates a build with updated contents of the `www` folder. If other assets need to be updated in the build such as Webblocks, check the **Cordova Build Process Details** section.


##### Troubleshooting

During the first time that `mobile_www_build` is executed, Grunt may stop it with an error. The error resolves if the `mobile_www_build` task is repeated again.


##### Cordova Build Process Details

`grunt mobile_firstrun` and `grunt ios_firstrun` do the following:

- cleans any mobile build folders, if they exist
- creates a cordova project in a build folder
- creates a hybrid_build folder containing only core assets, that are copied to the build folder
- overwrites the base config.xml with a custom config.xml
- replaces default icon and splash screens with custom icons
- adds cordova target platforms (defined in Gruntfile)
- adds plugins (defined in Gruntfile)

This task may be run again at any time if major changes to any of these assets are made.

There are also individual Grunt tasks, defined in the Gruntfile, for each of these actions, if needed to be performed separately.

##### Note on Using `cordovacli` tasks

If you need to execute a Grunt `cordovacli` task, you must navigate to the Cordova project build folder first. `cordovacli` tasks will **only** execute in the current directory that the `grunt` command is executed in, regardless of `options.path` settings in the `Gruntfile`. This is an open issue on the Github page for `cordovacli` [https://github.com/csantanapr/grunt-cordovacli/issues/12](https://github.com/csantanapr/grunt-cordovacli/issues/12). 

The `mobile_firstrun` task executes in the root folder without issues, and avoids this problem by executing a custom `grunt-exec` task with a forced `cwd` context from the shell.
